    <p class="p"> Ever since freshman year I have played on the PHS badminton team. Although sometimes challenging I enjoy the sport. Badminton season is in the spring and practice is everyday for 2 1/2 hours after school. We have games on thuesday and tuesday. During these matches I play girls single, that means I play against one other person. </p>

    <p class="p"> As of this year I joined Key Club international. This is a community service club at my high school. Last weekend some of our club members organized a charity bakesale. We ended up collecting 150 for Pediatric Trauma Program. </p>
